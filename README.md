## Architecture Overview

The project follows **MVC (Model-View-Controller)** with a single-source-of-truth state store:

```
┌─────────────┐     reads/writes     ┌──────────────┐
│  state.js   │◄────────────────────►│   game.js    │
│  (Model)    │                      │ (Controller)  │
└─────────────┘                      └──────┬───────┘
                                            │ calls
                                     ┌──────▼───────┐
                                     │    ui.js     │
                                     │   (View)     │
                                     └─────────────-┘
                                            │ uses
                               ┌────────────┴──────────┐
                          ┌────▼────┐           ┌──────▼──────┐
                          │ grid.js │           │  audio.js   │
                          │(Builder)│           │  (Service)  │
                          └─────────┘           └─────────────┘
```

**Key principle:** `game.js` is the only module that calls both `State` and `UI`. No other module calls both. This prevents circular dependencies and makes each module independently testable.

---

## Module Breakdown

### `config.js` — Data Layer
- Exports `LEVELS` array and `SCORE_CONFIG` object
- Both are frozen with `Object.freeze()` to prevent accidental mutation
- **Adding a new level = one new object in the array.** The engine requires no changes.

### `audio.js` — AudioManager Singleton
- Wraps the Web Audio API behind a simple `play(soundName)` interface
- All sounds synthesised procedurally — no audio files, no loading states, no CORS issues
- AudioContext created lazily on first user interaction (browser autoplay policy compliance)
- Background music uses an LFO-modulated oscillator for ambient texture

### `state.js` — State Store
- Single private `_state` object; never exposed directly
- `State.get()` returns a shallow copy (immutable snapshot)
- `State.set(partial)` merges updates — mirrors Redux's `dispatch`
- `State.resetLevel()` preserves `totalScore` and `currentLevel` while resetting all runtime fields

### `grid.js` — GridBuilder
- Builds decks using Fisher-Yates shuffle (O(n), unbiased)
- Creates card DOM elements with data attributes as identity (no separate lookup map)
- `buildGridFromSequence()` rebuilds the play grid in identical order to the memorize grid, so the layout is consistent across phases

### `ui.js` — View Layer
- Owns all `document.getElementById` calls
- Game logic never queries or mutates the DOM — it calls UI methods
- Screen transitions via `.screen.active` CSS class toggle
- Confetti generated programmatically (no images)

### `game.js` — Game Engine
- Memorize phase: builds grid face-up, runs countdown, flips face-down with stagger
- Match evaluation: `Array.every()` checks all flipped cards share the same emoji
- State machine: `phase` field controls which operations are valid at any time
- Timer: `setInterval` with pause guard (`if (state.isPaused) return`)

### `main.js` — Bootstrap
- Single `DOMContentLoaded` listener
- Wires all button `click` events to their handlers
- No game logic here — purely event wiring

---

## State Management

```js
// Single source of truth
State.get()   // → immutable snapshot
State.set({}) // → merge update
State.reset() // → full reset
State.resetLevel() // → preserve score/level, reset runtime

// Example state snapshot:
{
  currentLevel: 4,
  totalScore: 1250,
  moves: 7,
  matchesFound: 2,
  totalGroups: 3,
  timeRemaining: 58,
  comboCount: 2,
  levelScore: 300,
  flippedCards: [<div>, <div>, <div>],
  isLocked: false,
  isPaused: false,
  phase: "play",
  soundEnabled: true
}
```

**Why not React/Redux?** The state surface is small (< 15 fields) and transitions are simple (no async, no derived state). Introducing a framework would add complexity without benefit. If the game grew to include leaderboards, user profiles, or real-time multiplayer, migrating `state.js` to a Redux store or Zustand would be straightforward — the rest of the codebase wouldn't change.

---

## Level Design System

```js
{
  id: 7,
  gridCols: 4,
  gridRows: 4,
  groupSize: 4,        // 4 cards must be selected to form a match
  memorizeSeconds: 7,  // reveal duration
  timeLimit: 90,       // seconds to complete
  label: "Match QUADS — find 4 of each!",
  emojis: ["🔥","💧","🌿","🌊"],
}
```

**Validation rule:** `gridCols × gridRows` must equal `emojis.length × groupSize`. The engine trusts this implicitly — a linter or unit test could assert it at build time.

**Difficulty escalation axes:**
- Grid size (more cards → more positions to remember)
- Group size (pairs → triplets → quads → quints)
- Memorize time (shorter window → harder)
- Time limit (tighter constraint with larger grids)

---

## Audio System

All sounds use the Web Audio API's oscillator + gain node chain:

```
OscillatorNode → GainNode → AudioContext.destination
```

The gain node is ramped to 0 with `exponentialRampToValueAtTime` for natural fade-out. Staggered `delay` parameters produce arpeggios (the match sound) without needing multiple `AudioContext` instances.

**Browser autoplay policy:** `AudioContext` is created inside the first user-gesture handler (`btn-start` click), satisfying all modern browsers' autoplay restrictions.

---

## Key Algorithms

### Fisher-Yates Shuffle (`grid.js`)

```js
function fisherYates(arr) {
  for (let i = arr.length - 1; i > 0; i--) {
    const j = Math.floor(Math.random() * (i + 1));
    [arr[i], arr[j]] = [arr[j], arr[i]];
  }
  return arr;
}
```

- **O(n)** time, O(1) space
- Produces a uniformly random permutation (unlike `arr.sort(() => Math.random() - 0.5)` which is biased and O(n log n))

### Match Evaluation (`game.js`)

```js
const referenceEmoji = cards[0].dataset.emoji;
const isMatch = cards.every(c => c.dataset.emoji === referenceEmoji);
```

- Works for any `groupSize` (2–5) without branching
- O(groupSize) — effectively O(1) since groupSize ≤ 5

### Input Lock Pattern (`game.js`)

```js
State.set({ isLocked: true });
// ... async animation ...
State.set({ isLocked: false });
```

Prevents card clicks during mismatch animation without disabling event listeners. Simpler and more robust than removing/re-adding listeners.

## Scoring System

```
matchPoints = baseMatchPoints                        // 100
            + (groupSize - 2) × groupSizeMultiplier // 0 / 50 / 100 / 150
            + (comboCount - 1) × comboBonus         // 0 / 25 / 50 / ...

levelBonus  = timeRemaining × timeBonus             // awarded at level end
```

Star rating is based on fraction of time remaining:
- ⭐⭐⭐ → > 50% time left
- ⭐⭐   → > 20% time left
- ⭐     → anything else
